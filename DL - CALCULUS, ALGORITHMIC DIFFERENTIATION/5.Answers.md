### Questions
#### What is does it mean to *evaluate* a function at a point, *directed* at a point?
It means that we need to compute the _**directional derivative**_ of that function.

>To help us see how we’re going to define this change let’s suppose that a particle is sitting at (x0,y0)(x0,y0) and the particle will move in the direction given by the changing xx and yy. Therefore, the particle will move off in a direction of increasing xx and yy and the xx coordinate of the point will increase twice as fast as the yy coordinate. Now that we’re thinking of this changing xx and yy as a direction of movement we can get a way of defining the change. We know from Calculus II that vectors can be used to define a direction and so the particle, at this point, can be said to be moving in the direction:

#### What is *Directional Derivative*?

i.e.

*note*: vector $\vec{v}$ which shows the direction, has to be _**unit vector**_ (normalized).

### Questions
#### How to find min/max points of a multivariable function?
Here are the steps:
1. Take the [[5.Theories#Partial Derivatives|Partial Derivatives]] of the function with respect ot each variable
2. Set each derivative to zero (solve $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=0$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=0$, and so on)
3. The values $x_i=c_i$ where $x_i$ is the $i$th variable and $c_i$ the solution to step 2, construct the coordinate $C=(x_1, x_2, ... , x_i)$
4. Obtain the second derivative or [[5.Theories#Hessian|Hessian]] of the function $f$
5. Evaluate obtained Hessian matrix from step 4 at point $C$ from step 3. To do so, take the determinent of Hessian matrix from step 4.
6. If $\text{Det}(\text{Hessian}(x))>0$ then $f$ is convex and $C$ is a minimum and vice versa. For more info about this step, please see [[5.Theories#Finding local or global min or max using second derivative|How to find local optima using second derivative and convexity]].
