###  Clipping the input to sigmoid

why?

> Overflow! When $z$ is a large positive value, result of $e^{-z}$ moves toward $+\infty$ which causes overflow.

About gradients: 
>You put a dilation of 1e5 in your exponential. The exponential of 1e5 is so unbelievably high that there is no hope to get meaningful result here. You are probably getting a NaN because you are trying to backpropagate through a computational graph which at some point is evaluated to `inf` (and beyond!)

Some notes:
>Anyway, to make the slope of a function steeper, remember that `df(a.x)/dx = a.df(x)/dx` so you need to multiply its argument by a value greater than 1 (and not negative, you will change the sign of you derivative).
