#### Wald chi-squared test for importance of *interaction term*
>The [null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/) for the test is: _some parameter_ = _some value_. For example, you might be studying if weight is affected by eating junk food twice a week. “Weight” would be your parameter. The value could be zero (indicating that you don’t think weight is affected by eating junk food). If the [null hypothesis is rejected](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/support-or-reject-null-hypothesis/), it suggests that the variables in question can be removed without much harm to the model fit.

#### likelihood ratio test for importance of *interaction term*
>Basically, the test compares the fit of two models. The [null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/) is that the smaller model is the “best” model; It is rejected when the test statistic is large. In other words, if the [null hypothesis is rejected](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/support-or-reject-null-hypothesis/), then the larger model is a significant improvement over the smaller one.

>The test statistic approximates a [chi-squared](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/) random variable. [Degrees of freedom](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/degrees-of-freedom/) for the test equal the difference in the number of parameters for the two models.

### Questions
#### What is the relation between p-value and parameters of logistic regression? (i.e. importance of an attribute)
>A _p_-value less than 0.05 (typically ≤ 0.05) is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis.
>You should note that you cannot accept the null hypothesis, we can only reject the null or fail to reject it.
